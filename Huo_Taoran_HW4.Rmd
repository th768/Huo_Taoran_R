## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#question 1
#1. Create	the	vectors:	
#a) (1,2,3,...,19,20)

#c) (1,2,3,...,19,20,19,18,...,2,1)

#question 2
#2. Create	a	vector	of	the	values	of	e^xcos(x)	at	x	=	3,3.1,3.2,...,5.9,6.

#question 5
#5. Use	the	function	paste	to	create	the	following	character	vectors	of	length	30

#c) What	are	the	values	in	xVec	which	correspond	to	the	values	in	yVec	which	are	>	600?	(By	correspond,	we	mean	at	the	same	index	positions.

#d) Create	the	vector	(	|x1	???	????|1/2,	|x2	???	????|1/2,	.	.	.	,	|xn	???	????|1/2)	where	????	denotes	the	mean	of	the	vector	x	=	(x1,x2,...,xn).
